        <h1>What is OOP?</h1>
        
        <p>
            Before we can talk about calculators, we are going to need to know some basic terms. Those terms are Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction. 
        </p>

        <h3>Encapsulation</h3>
        <p> 
            All encapsulation is having all the variables and methods into a single entity. Encapsulation gives us the ability to acess required variables without having to provide the program full acess to any of the other variables. 

            An example of encapsulation in my calculaor program would this file below, and this is beacuase it is wrapping data and the methods that work on the data within one unit. The first portion of this class would be that.

            <p>

            </p>
        </p>

        <h3>Inheritance</h3>
        <p> 
        All inheritance means is that if one class can inherit from another class all of its components and properties, it is sort of like when someone dies and their next generation is able to inherit their money or wealth. 

        An example of inheritance in my calculator program would be this file below, and this is becuase the multiplication class inherits the methods and values from the calculations class. 

        <p> 
            https://github.com/saivishalc1/calc_example1/blob/main/calc/calculations/multiplication.py
        </p>
        
        </p>

        

        <h3>Polymorphism</h3>
        <p> 
        This means that it defines methods in the child class that have the same name as the methods in the parent class. For inheritance, as stated above it can also be that the child class inherits the method from the parent which is why the example of the money was given.

        An example of polymorphism in my calculator program would be this image below, and this is because in both subtraction and multiplation class they both refer to the same method which is get_result

        <p> 
            https://github.com/saivishalc1/calc_example1/blob/main/calc/calculations/subtraction.py
            https://github.com/saivishalc1/calc_example1/blob/main/calc/calculations/multiplication.py
        </p>

        </p>

        

        <h3>Abstraction</h3>
        <p> 
        Abstraction in programming is to hide all the internal implementations of the process or method from the user. The user in this case will be able to see what he is doing, but can not see how the work is being done. 

        An example of Abstraction in my calculator program would be this file below, and this is because could be the addition class, the user can't see the user functionailty of the looping or extra variables that are being made.
